Hello fellow reader, I'm glad you stumbled upon this journal!

### So who's Mindless?
Well, I am! I'm a 23 (so far) year-old italian guy with a strong interest in everything computer related. During a thing called life, I happened to have developed a marked interest in cybersecurity, especially in low-level pwnage.
As of now, my main interests include **binary exploitation** and **mobile hacking**, although **pentesting web apps** is still my main profession and holds a place in my heart.

In addition to that, I'm interested in pretty much everything, from physics, to music and cooking (and cats, of course, they probably sit in my top 1 preferred things in the world).

### What's this all about?
Well, for now the plan is to use this blog as a personal cyber-adventure memory album. Ideally, I'll post here the most interesting projects I jump on and everything I'll happen to experiment with (hoping I don't stop posting after writing this whoami, that is).

That being said, if you find any of this interesting or would like chat about anything, feel free to reach out wherever you prefer. 

Enjoy!
